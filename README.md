📈 Key Insights:

Sales and profit vary by region and state – some areas generate high sales but low profit.
Technology category is the most profitable; Office Supplies has lower profit margins.
High shipping cost affects overall profit; Same Day shipping is costly.
Few customers contribute to major sales – classic 80/20 rule observed.

📦 Dataset:
